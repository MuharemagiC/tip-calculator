### What I learned

I started learning typescript with react and I want to do some project with these technologies. Except TypeScript and React I implemented eslint and prittier rules with airbnb style. For styleing I tried to improve my skills in css modules.

For the future I want to improve my TypeScript, CSS and React skills. After it I will start learning new skills lik NextJS, GraphQL, NodeJS and more...
